# Java_Project8

This is one of my first projects in programming. I was tasked to do a program that can input
integer numbers from zero to ten thousand. And the expected output would be a conversion from numbers 
(you inputted) to words(Strings). In this problem, it took hours for me 
to realized that I should use switch case conditions
